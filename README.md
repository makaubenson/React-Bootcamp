# React.js

- React is a javascript library for buildimg user interfaces.
- To break it down:

  - Its a client side js library.
  - Its all about building modern reactive user interfaces for the web.

- React makes building complex,interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.
- React is all about `components`. This is because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components.

## Why React instead of JavaScript and it can still achieve the same thing.

- Js allows devs to write code in an imperative approach. It supports both imperative and declarative programming approaches, although its primary paradigm is imperative. In an imperative approach, developers write code that explicitly specifies the step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow.
- React allows devs to write code in a declarative,component focused approach.With React, developers describe the structure and behavior of their user interfaces by creating reusable components. These components encapsulate a specific piece of functionality and can be composed together to build complex UIs.

## BUilding Single-Page-Applications(SPAs)

- When working with React we often build single page applications.
- In a single page application, the server only sends one HTML page after which React takes over and controls the UI.

## Components

- Reusable building blocks in your user interfaces
- combination of css,js and html code
- Its not amust to re-use a component to confirm its a component.
- Components are the building blocks of React applications.

### Why Components?

- Allows for:
  - Reusability (Helps us ensure Dont Repeat yourself principle)
  - Separation of Concerns (Dont do too many things in one and the same place(function))

### How is a Component Built?

- By combining HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
- Basically we build our own custom HTML elements.

### React uses Declarative Approach

- This means, you only need to define the desired target state(s) and let react figure out the actuve JavaScript DOM instructions.
