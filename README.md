# React BootCamp

## What is React.js

- A client-side Js library for building user interfaces.
- Lean and focused Component based UI library.
- React focuses on components, so for more functionality, we use third party packages.
- React makes building complex,interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.

### It Builds?

- Interactive UIs,
- Nice transitions instantly
- Mpdern UIs

## Why Need React in addition to JavaScript since js can do most of what React can do.

- Js includes too much code for a simple task compared to react.
- Makes building modern complex UIs simple.

## Building Single-Page Applications(SPAs)

- Makes a web with multiple page act as a single page since it displays a page to user as if it requested in however it doesnt, it basically just changed the view, or what the user can see.

## React.js alternatives

- `Angular.js` - framework. It embraces typescript. Needed for complex, bigger projects.
- `Vue.js` - Framework, less features that angular, but more than vue.js.

## Course Outline in Summary

- Basics and Foundation
- Advanced Concepts(building for production)
- Summaries and Refreshers

## Components

- React is all about `components`.
- All user interfaces in the end are made up of components.

- `Components` are re-usable building blocks in your user interface. Not a must to re-use a component for it to be a component, it's just one of its traits that it is `re-usable`.
- Each component has one specific task that it focuses on.

### Why Components?

- Re-usability `(Don't Repeat Yourself)`
- Separation of concern `(Don't do too many things in one and the same place(function))`
