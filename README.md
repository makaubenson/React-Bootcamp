# React BootCamp

## What is React.js
- A client-side Js library for building user interfaces.
- Lean and focused Component based UI library.
- React focuses on components, so for more functionality, we use third party packages.

### It Builds?
- Interactive UIs,
- Nice transitions instantly
- Mpdern UIs

## Why Need React in addition to JavaScript since js can do most of what React can do.
- Js includes too much code for a simple task compared to react. 
- Makes building modern complex UIs simple.

## Building Single-Page Applications(SPAs)
- Makes a web with multiple page act as a single page since it displays a page to user as if it requested in however it doesnt, it basically just changed the view, or what the user can see.

## React.js alternatives
- `Angular.js` - framework. It embraces typescript. Needed for complex, bigger projects.
- `Vue.js` - Framework, less features that angular, but more than vue.js.
